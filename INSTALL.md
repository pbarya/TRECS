# T-RECS

T-RECS is a software package composed of two fortran codes, sampler and wrapper, and some ancillary python scripts. 

To build the package for the first time:

1) download the archive 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/crkzwho0hqc565g/TRECS_Inputs.tgz?dl=0

(size 33 Gb)
which contains input files with all the models used by the sampler code. Once extracted, 

tar -xvf TRECS_Inputs.tgz

move the folder without renaming it in the same folder where the T-RECS code folder is. Your folder should now contain: 

TRECS  TRECS_Inputs

2) check that you have a fortran compiler and these libraries are installed: GSL, Lapack, Healpix (compiled with shared/dynamic library option ticked), cfitsio

3) edit  sampler/Makefile and  wrapper/Makefile with your paths and compiler options

4) run "make" from both the sampler and the wrapper folders. the executables are saved in the bin folder. 


the python scripts require astropy and astropy.io to run.
